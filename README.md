# Whiteboard Tray

A simple connecting whiteboard tray.

## Building

`make` will generate `whiteboard-tray.stl` from the FreeCAD file if FreeCAD is installed and executable (the Makefile tries running it via Flatpak if `freecad` is not found).  The STL is included in the repository for convenience.
